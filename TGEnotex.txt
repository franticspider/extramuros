Notes on TGE-film 1

DONE - Fix the colours, so that when we hit 'eval', the text color changes back to white

DONE - fix the layout of the text boxes so that the bottom row is always aligned. 

DONE - eval doesn't seem to work after a pull until you do something in the textarea
-- Shift+Enter does work - eval button does not..


DONE- need to sort out what it is to Push, Pull &c - two actions isn't enough
		-- Push - simply pushes a pattern into the population: no change
		-- Pull - should pull a genome out of the population
		-- pullmut - should pull a mutated genome out - like pull did originally

DONE - problems with vowel pattern in the parser - 

- vowel appears too often. Need to balance the weighting of this

- Shape - number pattern is concatted together. Doesn't cause an error, but affects the pattern


====THINGS TO DO=====

1: make things a bit more variable in the sample sequence - add [] and *x and :y

2: add some of the trans_ops to the front of the message - shouldn't be too hard....

3: delete things as well as add them - particularly the |+| operators - should we have >1 of each?

4: Check that we get the right lists out of each operation - still get the occasional comma where it's not needed


5: Clear up the messages that appear on button press, and the colours of the boxes
